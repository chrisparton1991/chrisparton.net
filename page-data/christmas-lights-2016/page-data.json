I didn't meet my goal of having lights synchronised to music (which I'll\nexplain below), but I succeeded in putting together a reliable animation\nsequence using LED strips powered by an Arduino.\n\nYou can see the video below:\n\nI was looking through an Arduino blog post\n[https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/12/19/12-dazzling-holiday-light-displays-with-arduino/] \ntitled \"12 Dazzling Holiday Light Displays With Arduino\" one morning, and I was\npleasantly surprised to find my lights included in the list!\n\nGoals Accomplished\nI was really proud of myself for getting a display working with LED strips. I\nfailed plenty of times along the way, but I got there in the end. I'm utilising\nthe FastLED [https://fastled.io] library, which does a lot of the heavy lifting\nfor me.\n\nMy wiring is far from perfect, but it's a whole lot more robust than last year's\nefforts. I've learned a lot from this experience, and I think next year's lights\nwill be even more reliable. I've had just one cable-related issue with this\nyear's lights.\n\nGoals Missed\nI really wanted to have full sequencing working for this year's lights. I\nactually made a fair amount of progress down this road. I had my LED sequencing\nsoftware essentially working, and I could drive LED strips just fine. The main\nthing I had to figure out was how to turn those bytes of data into a kickass\nshow.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I started down the path of using one Arduino Due to\ndrive all of my LED strips. The Arduino would read the animation data from an SD\ncard and spit it out as needed. There were some downfalls with this approach,\nbut I didn't even get far enough to consider solving those.\n\nA Problem Of Distance\nMy display is using cheap-and-nasty UCS1903 LED strips. They generally do the\njob fine, but the data signal does not handle long distances very well. Even\nwith optimal placement of my Arduino Due (which would expose it to the\nelements), the distance between the Due and the farthest LED strips was so great\nthat the signal degraded to the point that the LED strips didn't even recognise\nit.\n\nGiving Up\nThis issue stumped me, and extinguished the flame that was my enthusiasm for the\nproject. I didn't touch it for quite some time. Eventually, I decided I still\nwanted something for this Christmas, and that something is what you can see in\nthe video above.\n\nAn Epiphany\nWhilst I was building my compromise project, I came across the wonders of the \nESP8266 [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678]. The ESP8266 (more accurately,\nthe ESP8266-based boards such as the ESP-01) are a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller\nthat pack quite a bit of processing power inside a tiny form factor for a very\nsmall price.\n\nI ordered a few of these from eBay and played around with them. I realised that\nthese chips could make my Christmas light dreams a reality. My sequencing\nsoftware would contain a UDP server that could be polled by 8266 boards to get\nanimation data and feed it to the LED strips. This approach works nicely for a\nfew reasons:\n\n * The 8266 controllers can be situated right next to the LED strips, so long as\n   they're within range of the Wi-Fi signal.\n * The server design means that the 8266 chips don't need to worry about\n   synchronising data, and can tolerate dropped packets and even a network\n   dropout.\n\nThis is what I'm working now, and will (hopefully) be the subject of various\nblog posts throughout the next year.\n\nUntil then, I'm happy with what I've been able to pull off for 2016.","html":"<p>My Christmas light display for 2016 is a definite improvement from what I had in 2015.
