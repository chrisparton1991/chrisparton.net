I've wanted to create a\nUdemy course for quite a while now, and I figured a course on LED pixels was the\nperfect place to start.\n\nYou can use this link\n[https://www.udemy.com/the-led-pixel-master-course/?couponCode=LPMC10] to get\nthe course for $10 using a special coupon :)\n\nI created the course because I had to build up my knowledge of LED pixels by\ncobbling together information (and misinformation) from multiple sources,\nincluding documentation, forums, online videos and lots of trial and error. I\nwant the course to be a single place where people can get all of the information\nthey need to learn all about LED pixels and how to use them.\n\nThe course focuses on safety and best practices throughout, whereas most video\ntutorials are more like step-by-step guides that don't explain why things are\ndone the way they are.\n\nI'm really proud of how the course turned out. I know that things can be\nimproved (and they will be over time), but for my first course I think it's a\nsolid effort.\n\nI thought I'd jot down some notes on the things I learned whilst creating the\ncourse.\n\nCamera\nI mainly used my Canon EOS M with an 18-55mm lens (set at around 24mm) to record\nthe course. I made use of a macro lens for some closeup shots of LED pixels, and\nused my Galaxy S7 to record some of the soldering etc.\n\nLighting\nI had never really recorded myself on camera for anything online before, and I\ndidn't want cruddy video quality. I took a look at some lighting tutorials\nonline and quickly realised I'd need to get my hands on some softboxes or\numbrella lights. I ended up snagging a great bargain on Gumtree: three softboxes\n(one of them with a boom stand) and two umbrella lights with a carry case for\n$80.\n\nAudio\nI was initially planning on investing in a Blue Yeti mic for my audio, but I\nended up going with the Rode SmartLav+ lapel mic. They cost $58 but I got one\nfor $36 through a friend at JB. The audio quality of the mic is really quite\ngood, but the main downside is that the mic uses a TRRS connector, and needs a\n$15 adapter to work with a PC.\n\nI ended up using the mic as-is with my phone to record videos where my face is\nbeing recorded, and bought the adapter to record straight into Audacity for\nscreen recorded videos (which are the majority).\n\nSoftware\nI went with Camtasia Studio for putting my videos together. I have experience\nwith Adobe After Effects, but I felt it'd be too heavyweight for putting\ntogether a course, and I was looking for productivity. Aside from a couple of\nbugs, Camtasia has been fantastic for quickly putting videos together.","html":"<p>Today, I released The LED Pixel Master Course on Udemy!
