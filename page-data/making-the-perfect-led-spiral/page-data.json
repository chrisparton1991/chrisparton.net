It was a quick and effective\nmethod, but the spacing and angle of the lights were far from perfect. It also\nmade me quite dizzy.\n\n2016: Craftsmanship (Hopefully)\nThis year the pillars will be pimped out with RGB LED strips, and I turned to\nthe powers of mathematics to help me create the perfect LED spiral.\n\nMy goal here is to have all four pillars set up identically. To achieve this, I\nneeded to learn a bit about how spirals work. After some Googling, I came across\nthis New Mexico State University page\n[https://www.math.nmsu.edu/~breakingaway/ebookofcalculus/HandsOnUnitsInvolvingIntegrals/StringAroundCan/StringAroundCanWebPage01.html]\n.\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n * Pillars:\n * Height: 1890mm\n * Circumference: 395mm\n * LED Strips (1 per pillar):\n * Length: 5000mm\n * Width: 13mm\n\nThe formula to describe the length of n spiral loops around a cylinder of height \nh and circumference c is as follows:\n\nl=n*c2+hn22This is pretty neat formula, I recommend taking a look at the link\nabove. Essentially, we solve for the length by using the height and\ncircumference of the cylinder the base and hypotenuse of an isosceles triangle,\nrespectively. If we have multiple loops, they each take up an equal proportion\nof the height of the cylinder, so we divide the height by the number of loops.\n\nFor example, take a cylinder with three loops:\n\nIllustration of a cylinder with three loops, which is actually just three\ndiagonal lines on a rectangleHowever, the length of the LED strip is already\nknown (5000mm). This means that we need to change the subject of the equation\nfrom l to n, since the number of loops is what we really care about here.\n\nNow, my high school math skills are quite rusty, so instead I just plugged\nvalues into this formula until I arrived at something very close to 5000mm\n(Sorry, Mr. Clarke). The result ended up being that I could fit 11.72 loops onto\neach pillar.\n\nDividing the height of the pillar by the number of loops yields 164.3, which\ngives me the gap between each loop at any point in the spiral.\n\nA Consistent Angle\nOk great, I can fit 11.72 loops onto my pillar. This information gave me\nsomething to aim for, but it didn't really help me to make my work more\naccurate. I needed something more. I decided that \"something\" was a template I\ncould use to guarantee consistent pitch and spacing of the strip:\n\nTemplates Make Everything Easier\nA couple of cardboard templates, based on the above measurementsI made two\ntemplates. The first one is a triangle shape, used for the bottom-most loop of\nthe spiral. The dimensions of the template are as follows:\n\n * Width: 395mm\n * Height: 151.3mm\n\nThe width is simple enough at 395mm (the circumference of the pillar), but where\ndoes the 151.3mm height come from? Well, it's the gap between the spiral loops\n(as calculated previously), minus the width of the LED strip itself.\n\nThe second template is for the general case, where one spiral needs to sit atop\nanother.\n\nAs with the previous template, the width is simply the circumference of the\npillar. The height is 302.6mm, i.e. double the height of the first template.\nThis is because we need a consistent gap, but the spiral itself is getting\nhigher at the same time. Overlaying the templates on the previous flattened\ncylinder image makes this clearer:\n\nTemplates overlaid on the flattened cylinderThe red triangle is the first\ntemplate, which has a flat bottom because it's sitting against the bottom of the\ncylinder. The blue quadrilateral is made up of two triangles with the same\ndimensions of the first template. All subsequent loops will use this template.\n\nFinally...\nI didn't wrap the pillar in its entirety, because I didn't have time to take it\ndown again, but here are the first two loops of the spiral in all their glory:\n\nAn LED strip wrapped around my pillar, assisted by the cardboard templates","html":"<h2 id=\"2015-hack\">2015: Hack</h2><p>As mentioned in my previous post, I have four pillars on the front of my house that are just begging to be covered in lights.</p><p>My approach last year was to run around the pillars with a bunch of Christmas lights in my hand and let them wind themselves up.
