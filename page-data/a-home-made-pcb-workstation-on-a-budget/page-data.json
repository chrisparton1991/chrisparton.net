However, as I progressed I grew more and more\nfrustrated with the lack of manoeuvrability the third hand provided.\n\nIf you haven't seen one of these before, they look like this:\n\n\nA \"third hand\" tool, useful for holding wires and components when solderingThird\nHand++\nThe horizontal bar that connects the arms to the stands limits the usefulness of\nthis tool. I looked online for alternatives, and found an Instructable for a\nhome-made PCB workstation called Third Hand++\n[http://www.instructables.com/id/Third-Hand-A-multi-use-helping-hand-for-electro/]\n:\n\n\nLike a third hand, but more flexibleI liked this setup much more than the\nconventional third hand. Unfortunately, living in Australia, some of these\nmaterials aren't as easy or cheap to come by. Therefore, I decided to make my\nown clone of the Third Hand++, using cheap and/or readily available materials.\n\nMy PCB Workstation\nHere's my workstation, in all its splendour:\n\n\nMy take on the Third Hand++Equipment Required\n * Some kind of cutting device, e.g. circular saw, jigsaw, hacksaw (along with\n   appropriate safety gear!)\n * Hot glue gun (I suspect a silicone gun would work too)\n * Blu-Tack\n * Electric drill\n * 3mm bit\n * 5mm bit\n * 10mm bit\n\nMaterials\nItem Price (AUD) Projecta Alligator Clips - 6 Pack\n[http://www.bunnings.com.au/projecta-alligator-clips-6-pack_p6330687] $2.50\n(Bunnings) CustomWood MDF 900 x 450 x 12mm Standard MDF Panel\n[http://www.bunnings.com.au/customwood-mdf-900-x-450-x-12mm-standard-mdf-panel_p0590092]\n $8.15 (Bunnings) Fiddly Bits 250g Flat Black Spray Paint\n[http://www.bunnings.com.au/fiddly-bits-250g-flat-black-spray-paint_p1580054] \n$2.95 (Bunnings) 20mm x 3mm Steel Screws - Pk.25\n[http://www.jaycar.com.au/Electromechanical-Components/Fasteners-%26-Hardware/Fasteners/20mm-x-3mm-Steel-Screws---Pk-25/p/HP0410]\n $3.50 (Jaycar) 3mm Steel Nuts - Pk.25\n[http://www.jaycar.com.au/Electromechanical-Components/Fasteners-%26-Hardware/Fasteners/3mm-Steel-Nuts---Pk-25/p/HP0425]\n $2.95 (Jaycar) Madico 19mm Clear Round Vinyl Surface Protection Bumper Pads -\n6\nPack\n[http://www.bunnings.com.au/madico-19mm-clear-round-vinyl-surface-protection-bumper-pads-6-pack_p3979349]\n $4.25 (Bunnings) 2 mini tripods (search eBay for \"Mini Octopus Flexible\nTripod\", lowest price first) Approx. $7.50 for 2 tripods (eBay) Total: $31.80\nIt's worth noting that all of the above materials, apart from the tripods and\n(optional) foot stickers, are enough to make at least two of my PCB\nworkstations. If you can find a smaller MDF board and smaller packs of screws\nand nuts, you will be able to significantly reduce the price to create one\nworkstation.\n\nConstruction\nStep 1: Measure and Cut MDF\nYou can make your workstation any size you like, but there are multiple\nvariables to consider, such as:\n\n * The weight of the base\n * Ease of portability\n * The size of the PCBs you want to work on\n * The number of anchor points you want\n * The strength and flexibility of the arms\n\nThe last one is important. If your arms are too long, they won't be able to hold\nmuch weight at all. However, if they are too short, they won't be flexible\nenough to be particularly useful.\n\nI settled on making my board 25x25 cm with 8 anchor points, which I'm happy with\nin retrospect.\n\nSo, the first task is to cut your board to size.\n\nStep 2: Mark the Holes\nI made my four corner anchor point holes 2.5cm from each side of the board. The\nmiddle four anchor points are simply the midpoints between the others.\n\nMy resized MDF board with marked anchor point holes:\n\nThe MDF with holes marked for drillingStep 3: Drill the Holes\nUsing a 3mm drill bit, drill out all of your marked anchor points, the whole way\nthrough.\n\nUsing a 10mm drill bit, drill  shallow holes into the anchor points on the\nunderside of the MDF (it doesn't matter which side, use the rougher/uglier side\nif there is one). The idea here is to provide a hole large enough for the nut to\nfit into so the MDF can sit flush on a surface.\n\n\nThe MDF with holds drilled and countersunkStep 4: Spray Paint\nThis is where you can let your inner artist blossom, or in my case, not. I opted\nfor el cheapo matte black spray paint, which looks awful in the image below.\nThis is largely because I don't have much experience spray painting, and also\nbecause the camera flash throws my inadequacies into sharp relief.\n\nStill, my advice is to make several light passes over one side (and the edges),\nthen flip and repeat once the paint is dry.\n\nStep 5: Attach Bumper Pads\nNothing too exciting here, just flip your MDF over and stick on the rubber/vinyl\nbumper pads. This will prevent your workstation from scratching whatever it's\nsitting on as you move it around.\n\nStep 6: Attach Anchor Points\nYou know those tripods I told you to buy? This is where they start becoming\nuseful. Yank off the three legs, and do what you wish with the holder section.\n\nWith a little force, these segmented legs come apart. Pull out as many\nindividual segments as you have anchor points, and drill a hole down the middle\nof them using a 3mm bit. I used my Dremel drill press\n[https://www.dremel.com/en-au/attachments/pages/productdetail.aspx?pid=220-01],\nbut I imagine it can be done using a regular drill and. Be careful to get the\nhole in the centre, or you'll drill through the side of the anchor point.\n\nIf you've succeeded, you should now be able to attach the anchor points to your\nMDF using the 20mm screws. These screws were just long enough for me to attach\nwith countersunk holes. I had to make a few of my countersinks a bit deeper to\nget them on. I put my screws in so that the nuts are on the underside of the\nboard, and the screwheads are in the top of the anchor points.\n\nOnce your anchor points are attached, you should have something that looks\nroughly like this:\n\nNearly done! Anchor points attached and sprayed matte blackStep 7: Make Tool\nArms\nNow for the (relatively) tricky part: putting the alligator clips into segments\nto form tool arms. Start by figuring out how many clips you think will be\nuseful. If you want lots of clips, you may have to purchase more tripods so you\nhave more arm segments to work with. I decided to make four tool arms.\n\nMy alligator clips have a 5mm diameter at their base, so I drilled a 5mm hole\ninto four segments (I actually used my Dremel cutting bit\n[https://www.dremel.com/en-au/Accessories/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=561] to\nhack a hole roughly 5mm, but a 5mm hole would be a bit cleaner. You can see my\nrough handiwork below:\n\nA drilled segment, ready for an alligator clipNow, get a blob of Blu-Tack about\nthe size of a grape. Sit the anchor point on it, large side touching the tack.\nPush hard so that the tack fills up most of the large chamber in the segment.\n\nNext, gently push an alligator clip through the top (small) hole, so that it's\nheld in place by the tack. The clip should protrude from the segment just enough\nto allow the clip to be opened and closed without interference.\n\nFinally, use a hot glue gun to pump glue in around the clip shaft, filling up\nthe small chamber. Leave to solidify, then gently remove the tack. The large\nchamber should be mostly devoid of glue, as it needs to be empty to accommodate\nother segments being pushed into it.\n\nIf you want to tidy up the glue, you can carefully cut and scrape away excess\nusing a sharp blade like a craft or X-Acto knife.\n\nThe end result should look something like this:\n\nA segment with an alligator clip attached using hot glueStep 8: Pat Self On Back\nCongratulations, you've created all of the components for your PCB workstation!\nAll you have to do now is grab a chain of segments, plug them into an anchor\npoint, and attach a tool arm to the end of the segment chain.\n\nFuture Enhancements\nThere are a few things that could be done to this workstation to make it even\nniftier, such as:\n\n * An LED tool arm, powered by 2xAA batteries attached to the board.\n * A small fan tool arm, to extract soldering fumes (maybe the fan could be held\n   up like a diamond, with two anchor points for added stability. This would\n   need to be powered from something beefier, like a 12V power supply.\n * Shrink wrapping the alligator clip jaws to help prevent wear and tear to\n   PCBs.\n * Attaching a PCB Holder\n   [http://www.aliexpress.com/price/baku-pcb-holder_price.html] to the base of\n   the workstation.","html":"<h2 id=\"third-hand\">Third Hand</h2><p>Back before I started tinkering with electronics, I bought a third hand.
