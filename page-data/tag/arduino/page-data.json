I dusted off Sparkled and got to work. I'm really proud of what I accomplished in the last three months of the year.</p><p>I started off by doing a huge refactor of the codebase. I changed the underlying database from Postgres to file-based H2 and completed loads of missing functionality. I was working away at this all through December, so I didn't have a lot of time to actually sequence the music.</p><h4 id=\"a-sneak-peek\">A Sneak Peek</h4><p>Here's a sequence playing against a shortened, instrumental version of Coldplay's A Sky Full Of Stars:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjgJN3SzmT0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I put this together in around three hours total. I made some mistakes with the sequence and the music is a little off-sync because I hastily added a clean audio track over top of the recorded audio, but the video shows that Sparkled is capable of pulling off an awesome Christmas display.</p><h4 id=\"what-s-next\">What's Next</h4><p>I'm feeling ready to jump back in to GirtGames and get my first game out to the world. I'll still be devoting lots of time to Sparkled throughout the year. I'll be adding new features and effects, rewriting the UI in React, and building a significantly better Christmas display.</p><p>I moved Sparkled to its own GitHub organisation and created some basic content for <a>sparkled.io</a> with the hope that a community will form around the software as it becomes more feature complete.</p>","url":"https://chrisparton.net/christmas-lights-2017/","uuid":"63f8ec24-11e9-4fbe-abdd-74943e82eab3","page":false,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5d60ab455655c53c345c8049"}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5d60aac65655c53c345c8034","title":"My First Jack-O'-Lantern","slug":"my-first-jack-o-lantern","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/jack-o-lantern.jpg","excerpt":"Halloween isn't a traditional Australian holiday, but it is becoming more prevalent with each passing year.

I want to keep these for this year's display, but I have\nplans to make a display that synchronises to music. I want to turn the regular\nlights off when this display is active to maximise the impact.\n\nOptions...\nThere are a few ways to achieve this.\n\nPowerSwitch Tail\nPowerSwitch Tail\n[http://www.powerswitchtail.com/Pages/PowerSwitchTail240vackit.aspx] is a range\nof kits that can be put together with two ends of a mains cable of your\nchoosing. The kit has (low voltage) inputs that can be accessed by a\nmicrocontroller to effectively turn the power on and off.\n\nThe problem is, these kits are reasonably pricey and would presumably have to be\nordered in from overseas. Also, there's still a degree of danger in wiring these\nthings up.\n\nRelay\nThe cheaper option would be to simply chop a mains cable in half and stick an\nappropriately rated relay in there. This is even more dangerous, and I prefer my\nhouse when it's not on fire.\n\nRemote Control Switches\nAt the FinoComp office, we've just ordered in some components to create a neat\ncontinuous integration light based on a pedestrian crossing light. We're using\ntwo Z-Wave Switch Plugin\n[http://zwave.com.au/index.php?_a=viewProd&productId=30] units and a RaZberry\n[http://zwave.com.au/index.php?_a=viewProd&productId=97] daughterboard to\ncontrol them.\n\nThis is probably the most reliable and safe method to achieve what I want, but\nat $65 a pop for the switches and $95 for the RaZberry, it's much more costly\nthan what I want.\n\nWhat, Then?\nThere's one final option. Take a cheap, remote control power outlet and hack it\nto support input from a microcontroller. As you may have guessed, this is the\napproach I ended up taking.\n\nI bought an Arlec Remote Control Power Outlet\n[http://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-remote-control-power-outlet-_p4331239] from\nBunnings for $13. The reason I chose this unit (apart from being cheap), is that\nit has separate \"On\" and \"Off\" buttons, which I assumed meant separate signals\nfor turning the outlet on and off. This is very important, because the\ncommunication is typically unidirectional in these things.\n\nThe outlet, complete with one unmolested controllerIf the same signal is sent to\ntoggle power and there's no way to know the state of the outlet, the state of\nthe outlet may quickly become out of sync with what my software expects. Having\nseparate signals means I can send the same signal a bunch of times to increase\nthe likelihood of it being received.\n\nI cracked open the controller to see what I was dealing with. The quality of the\ncircuit board isn't stellar, but it's good enough for my purposes. The circuit\nitself isn't too complex. Basically a bunch of buttons attached to a Holtek\nHT48R01T3 MCU [http://www.holtek.com/pdf/consumer/4xR01T3v130.pdf], which\ncontains an RF transmitter.\n\nInside the controller there are lots of buttons on a very plain PCBThe underside\nof the PCB is a little more interesting, with a microcontroller and other\ncomponentsNow, there are various blog posts around the place that detail ways to\ncapture IR signals, send them through a PC microphone jack and analyse their\nwaveforms in order to reproduce the signals.\n\nThing is, I'm too lazy to do all that if it can be avoided. I decided to simply\nrewire the \"All On\" and \"All Off\" buttons to allow me to control them from an\nArduino Due.\n\nRewiring The Controller\nI ended up adding four wires in total. Two of these wires were simply to allow\nthe remote to be powered by my Arduino Due instead of using batteries. The\nremote ran from two 1.5V LR44 batteries in series. The Arduino Due works with\n3.3V, which is close enough for me. Of course, I measured the current draw\nthrough the remote before trying this. It was only 8mA, which is a small enough\namount to run through the Arduino without blowing it up.\n\nThe other two wires were added to the positive side of the \"All On\" and \"All\nOff\" buttons, respectively. I worked out which side of the buttons were the\npositive side using the DC voltage mode on my multimeter.\n\nThese pins are connected to the Arduino, and are kept high. When one of the pins\nis brought low, the button is effectively circumvented, completing the circuit\nand allowing the signal to be sent. The nice thing about my approach is that the\nbuttons can still be used, even when the controller is connected to the Arduino.\n\nI finished the job by applying hot glue to prevent the wires from moving about\nand breaking. It's ugly, but I don't need it to be pretty for what I'm doing.\n\nA crude wired connection with some hot glue to keep the wires in placeThe Code\nI've only written a basic test program to ensure the controller can turn the\noutlet on and off. Here it is for completeness:\n\n#define ON_PIN 22\n#define OFF_PIN 23\n#define TIME_BETWEEN_POWER_TOGGLE_MS 5000\n#define MESSAGE_DURATION_MS 500\n\nvoid setup() {\n    pinMode(ON_PIN, OUTPUT);\n    digitalWrite(ON_PIN, HIGH);\n    \n    pinMode(OFF_PIN, OUTPUT);\n    digitalWrite(OFF_PIN, HIGH);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  turnOn();\n  delay(TIME_BETWEEN_POWER_TOGGLE_MS);\n  turnOff();\n  delay(TIME_BETWEEN_POWER_TOGGLE_MS);\n}\n\nvoid turnOn() {\n    sendMessage(ON_PIN);\n}\n\nvoid turnOff() {\n    sendMessage(OFF_PIN);\n}\n\nvoid sendMessage(int pin) {\n  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);\n  delay(MESSAGE_DURATION_MS);\n  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);\n}\n\n\nThe Finished Product\nHere's a video of the controller in action.","html":"<p>Messing around with 240V wiring isn't something I've ever been particularly eager to do, but I wanted a way to programmatically toggle one or more devices running on mains power.</p><p>If you've seen my <a href=\"http://chrisparton.net/2016/01/17/christmas-lights-2015/\">2015 Christmas Light</a> post, you may have noticed that I have a bunch of traditional Christmas lights that aren't programmed in any way.

The quality of the circuit board isn't stellar, but it's good enough for my purposes. The circuit itself isn't too complex. Basically a bunch of buttons attached to a <a href=\"http://www.holtek.com/pdf/consumer/4xR01T3v130.pdf\">Holtek HT48R01T3 MCU</a>, which contains an RF transmitter.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-21.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Inside the controller there are lots of buttons on a very plain PCB</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-22.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The underside of the PCB is a little more interesting, with a microcontroller and other components</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Now, there are various blog posts around the place that detail ways to capture IR signals, send them through a PC microphone jack and analyse their waveforms in order to reproduce the signals.</p><p>Thing is, I'm too lazy to do all that if it can be avoided. I decided to simply rewire the \"All On\" and \"All Off\" buttons to allow me to control them from an Arduino Due.</p><h2 id=\"rewiring-the-controller\">Rewiring The Controller</h2><p>I ended up adding four wires in total. Two of these wires were simply to allow the remote to be powered by my Arduino Due instead of using batteries. The remote ran from two 1.5V LR44 batteries in series. The Arduino Due works with 3.3V, which is close enough for me. Of course, I measured the current draw through the remote before trying this. It was only 8mA, which is a small enough amount to run through the Arduino without blowing it up.</p><p>The other two wires were added to the positive side of the \"All On\" and \"All Off\" buttons, respectively. I worked out which side of the buttons were the positive side using the DC voltage mode on my multimeter.</p><p>These pins are connected to the Arduino, and are kept high. When one of the pins is brought low, the button is effectively circumvented, completing the circuit and allowing the signal to be sent. The nice thing about my approach is that the buttons can still be used, even when the controller is connected to the Arduino.</p><p>I finished the job by applying hot glue to prevent the wires from moving about and breaking. It's ugly, but I don't need it to be pretty for what I'm doing.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-23.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>A crude wired connection with some hot glue to keep the wires in place</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id=\"the-code\">The Code</h2><p>I've only written a basic test program to ensure the controller can turn the outlet on and off.

I\nchose to work with this first because it looked like something I could tackle\nwith difficulty, which I believe is conducive to Flow\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)]. The fact that this was the\nfirst item to arrive in the mail also played a part in my decision.\n\nI set out with a goal to make a scrolling message panel, albeit a small one. I'm\npleased to say that I was able to achieve this, and I learned a lot along the\nway. I hope that by recording my projects in this blog that I'll further\nsolidify my understanding of electrical theory.\n\nThe end result is this:\n\nStep 1: What Are All These Pins For?\nThe Datasheet\n[https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LED/YSM-1288CR3G2C2.pdf] for my\nLED matrix wasn't exactly clear to me the first time I read it. The pinout\nleaves a lot to be desired as far as clarity goes:\n\nLED matrix wiring diagramSo the pinout tells us a few things:\n\n 1. There are 24 pins in total (8 red anodes, 8 green anodes, 8 common cathodes)\n 2. The pins are in a crazy order.\n\nWhat the pinout doesn't tell us, is the physical location of the pins on the\nmatrix. The matrix is perfectly square, with no indicator of which pin is pin 1.\nSo, I had to deduce that through trial and error. I wired up all of the pins,\nthen tested pins until I found the anode and cathode for a corner LED:\n\nThe LED matrix connected to a breadboardSo, we now know that two consecutive\npins can be used to power a corner LED. Given the assumption that the pins are\nordered sequentially on the LED matrix, those pins can only be the following:\n\n * Pins 2 and 3\n * Pins 10 and 11\n * Pins 14 and 15\n * Pins 22 and 23\n\nBy process of elimination, it turns out that none of the options are possible.\nThe most correct option on that list is that the circuit is using pins 22 and\n23. The only incorrect part is that the pinout states that pin 23 is connected\nto the anode for a green LED. It turns out that the datasheet is incorrect, the\nblack anodes actually depict red LEDs (lesson learned: never take a datasheet\nfor gospel).\n\nArmed with this knowledge, it was possible to figure out what all of the other\npins are for. The image below is using the same orientation as the image\nprevious image:\n\nPin diagram for the LED matrixStep 2: Wiring Up\nNow that we know what on earth the pins are for, this step is pretty easy, if\nnot a bit tedious. Since I'm using the Sparkfun Redboard\n[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757] (equivalent to the Arduino Uno), I\nonly have 13 digital out pins. Obviously, this isn't enough to accommodate all\nof the pins on the matrix.\n\nI decided to compromise and only use the red LEDs, which means I still need 16\npins. Fortunately, the analog in pins can also be used as digital output pins,\nso the final wiring looks like this:\n\nAs a convention, I used red and orange cables to connect to the red LED anodes,\nand green and blue cables to connect to the common cathodes. I placed 330Ω\nresistors in series with each anode connection (more on that later). The\nconnections are as follows:\n\nArduino Pin Matrix Pin Pin Type 2 11 Red Anode 3 8 Red Anode 4 5 Red Anode 5 2 \nRed Anode 6 14 Red Anode 7 17 Red Anode 8 20 Red Anode 9 23 Red Anode 11 13 \nCommon Cathode 12 10 Common Cathode A0 6 Common Cathode A1 3 Common Cathode A2 \n13 Common Cathode A3 16 Common Cathode A4 19 Common Cathode A5 22 Common Cathode \nStep 3: Making It Do Stuff\nOne hard truth I was hit with pretty early on is that making a legible picture\nshow up on this thing wasn't going to be as simple as I had hoped.\n\nThere are 16 pins wired up, each with two possible states: On or Off. This\nequates to 216 possible voltage states that the pins can be in. However, there\nare 64 LEDs wired up (disregarding the green LEDs), which equates to 264 \npossible LED states. This means that it's impossible to make any pattern of LEDs\nlight up at a given time (it's a violation of the Pigeonhole Principle\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle]).\n\nMy plan instead, then, was to only ever display one pixel at a time. That might\nsound like a pretty silly way to make an image scroller, but this actually isn't\ntoo dissimilar to the way old-fashioned CRT monitors work.\n\nBy turning single LEDs on for fractions of a second and repeating, we can trick\nthe human eye into perceiving a still image. By feeding multiple images into\nthis process, we can make it look like an image is moving.\n\nThe other advantage of this approach is that current will only be drawn for 0 or\n1 LED at any given instance. This means that standard resistors can be used. If\nwe were lighting up multiple pixels in a given column at the same time, a more\nsophisticated method would have to be used (and with my current skillset, I\ndon't know what that would be).\n\nStep 4: The Code\nI've included comments in the code below to act as an explanation:\n\n// The number of LEDs in the matrix in one dimension.\n#define LED_MATRIX_SIZE 8\n\n// The width of each letter when displayed on the matrix, including one column for\n// spacing between letters.\n#define LETTER_WIDTH 6\n#define REPAINT_COUNT 50\n\n// Red pins, in left-to-right order.\n// Physical pin attachments to LED matrix: 11, 8, 5, 2, 14, 17, 20, 23.\nconst byte RED_PINS[LED_MATRIX_SIZE] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\n\n// Ground pins, in top-to-bottom order (skip pin 13 to avoid using the integrated LED).\n// Physical pin attachments to LED matrix: 22, 19, 16, 13, 3, 6, 9, 12.\nconst byte GROUND_PINS[LED_MATRIX_SIZE] = {A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0, 12, 11};\n\n/* Binary representation of each letter, where 1 indicates an \"On\" pixel and 0 indicates\n * \"Off\", e.g. the letter \"A\" is defined as 0b0111010001111111000110001.

Cheers!","html":"<p>Having nearly completed the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit guidebook, I went on a purchasing frenzy, acquiring loads of various electronic components online.</p><p>Amongst these was a <a href=\"https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/products/led-matrix-dual-color-small\">Dual Colour 8x8 LED Matrix</a>. I chose to work with this first because it looked like something I could tackle with difficulty, which I believe is conducive to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">Flow</a>. The fact that this was the first item to arrive in the mail also played a part in my decision.</p><p>I set out with a goal to make a scrolling message panel, albeit a small one. I'm pleased to say that I was able to achieve this, and I learned a lot along the way. I hope that by recording my projects in this blog that I'll further solidify my understanding of electrical theory.</p><p>The end result is this:</p><h2 id=\"step-1-what-are-all-these-pins-for\">Step 1: What Are All These Pins For?</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LED/YSM-1288CR3G2C2.pdf\">Datasheet</a> for my LED matrix wasn't exactly clear to me the first time I read it. The pinout leaves a lot to be desired as far as clarity goes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>LED matrix wiring diagram</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So the pinout tells us a few things:</p><ol><li>There are 24 pins in total (8 red anodes, 8 green anodes, 8 common cathodes)</li><li>The pins are in a crazy order.</li></ol><p>What the pinout <em>doesn't</em> tell us, is the physical location of the pins on the matrix. The matrix is perfectly square, with no indicator of which pin is pin 1. So, I had to deduce that through trial and error. I wired up all of the pins, then tested pins until I found the anode and cathode for a corner LED:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>The LED matrix connected to a breadboard</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, we now know that two consecutive pins can be used to power a corner LED. Given the assumption that the pins are ordered sequentially on the LED matrix, those pins can only be the following:</p><ul><li>Pins 2 and 3</li><li>Pins 10 and 11</li><li>Pins 14 and 15</li><li>Pins 22 and 23</li></ul><p>By process of elimination, it turns out that none of the options are possible. The most correct option on that list is that the circuit is using pins 22 and 23. The only incorrect part is that the pinout states that pin 23 is connected to the anode for a <em>green</em> LED. It turns out that the datasheet is incorrect, the black anodes actually depict <em>red</em> LEDs (lesson learned: never take a datasheet for gospel).</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, it was possible to figure out what all of the other pins are for. The image below is using the same orientation as the image previous image:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Pin diagram for the LED matrix</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id=\"step-2-wiring-up\">Step 2: Wiring Up</h2><p>Now that we know what on earth the pins are for, this step is pretty easy, if not a bit tedious. Since I'm using the <a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757\">Sparkfun Redboard</a> (equivalent to the Arduino Uno), I only have 13 digital out pins. Obviously, this isn't enough to accommodate all of the pins on the matrix.</p><p>I decided to compromise and only use the red LEDs, which means I still need 16 pins. Fortunately, the analog in pins can also be used as digital output pins, so the final wiring looks like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://chrisparton.net/content/images/2019/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>As a convention, I used red and orange cables to connect to the red LED anodes, and green and blue cables to connect to the common cathodes.
